WISHLIST:
- control bar for speed (time-based animation)
- use online libraries, e.g.
	<script src="https://rawgithub.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/build/three.js"></script>

BUGS:
- if I want to use "OrbitControl", the camera must look at (0,0,0) at the beginning

- see:
ThreeJS camera.lookAt() has no effect, is there something I'm doing wrong?
